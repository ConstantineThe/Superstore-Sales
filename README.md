# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 📝 Project Overview
This project leverages **Power BI** to analyze sales data from a global superstore chain. The goal was to identify profit leaks, optimize discounting strategies, and visualize regional performance trends to support data-driven decision-making.
## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Interactive Drill-Downs:** Explore performance from Region → State → City level.
*   **Profitability Analysis:** Identify products and categories operating at a loss.
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** Slice data by Year, Segment, and Ship Mode.
*   **Custom DAX Measures:** Advanced calculations for Profit Margin, YoY Growth, and Moving Averages.
## 💡 Key Insights (Example - Please Verify)
*   **Furniture Category:** While generating high revenue, the 'Tables' sub-category is operating at a net loss due to excessive discounting.
*   **Regional Trends:** The West region is the most profitable, while the South requires strategic intervention to improve margins.
*   **Discount Efficiency:** Discounts exceeding 20% dramatically reduce profitability without a proportional increase in sales volume.
